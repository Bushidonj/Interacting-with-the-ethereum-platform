# What is Ethereum

<h3> Ethereum is a decentralized platform, in which its purpose is to create applications and smart contracts.</h3>
<h3>In addition, its applications are fully proof of censorship, fraud or interference from third parties. Giving security to users of this technology. All blocks that keep your information are also available to all users so that each one can have their own copy, guaranteeing the immutability of all applications on the network. </h3>
